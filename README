A ruby script that will automatically follow all your followers.

Gem dependencies:
* twitter

Usage:
follower = AutoFollower.new('admin@example.com', 'password')
follower.start

NB: 
Twitter has limit on how many people you can follow in an hour.
But if you schedule this script to run hourly it will eventually catchup.
