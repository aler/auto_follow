A ruby script that will automatically follow all your followers.

Gem dependencies:
* twitter >= 0.2.6
* hpricot

Usage:
follower = AutoFollower.new('admin@example.com', 'password')
follower.start
follower.stalk('cincinnati')

Another option if you only want to follow your followers is
running it off command line like auto_follow.rb admin@example.com password

You can black list people from been added to your friend by adding them to the yaml file called black_list.yml.
The script will also construct a black_list.yml once it finishes because it might add more names to the list.

NB:
Twitter has limit on how many people you can follow in an hour.
But if you schedule this script to run hourly it will eventually catchup.
